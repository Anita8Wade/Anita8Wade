## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a data scientist with experience in natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning, specializing in building predictive models that transform raw data into meaningful insights and actionable outcomes. This space serves as a portfolio of projects, experiments, and tools developed to explore complex data challenges and advance applied machine learning techniques.

My work focuses on combining NLP and deep learning to build models that understand and generate human language, as well as forecast future outcomes based on historical patterns. Iâ€™ve worked with a variety of data sources, including unstructured text, structured datasets, and time-series data, applying techniques such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and sequence-to-sequence learning.

Using Python and popular libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and Hugging Face Transformers, I develop and fine-tune models for tasks like classification, regression, and language understanding. I also integrate these models into scalable pipelines that can be deployed for real-world applications, such as recommendation systems, churn prediction, or document classification.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find projects that demonstrate the full data science workflowâ€”from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment. Each project emphasizes reproducibility, clarity, and practical value, often supported by Jupyter notebooks and modular codebases.

My goal is to solve real problems through data, with a strong focus on interpretability, model performance, and end-to-end usability. I enjoy exploring how machine learning and NLP can be used to uncover patterns, automate decisions, and enhance user experiences.

Feel free to explore the work, share feedback, or connect over shared interests in AI, deep learning, and data science. Iâ€™m always open to learning more and collaborating on meaningful, data-driven projects.
